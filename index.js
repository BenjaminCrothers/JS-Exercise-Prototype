  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
      - All instances built with Car:
          + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
          + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
      - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
      - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

      - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    
    1. If "this" is contained in a global function it reaches to the window as an object.
    
    2. "." notation assings "this" to an object.
    
    3.   When creating new objects, "this" references the prototype.
    
    4. "Call" and "apply" methods are used in objects with explicitely defined "this"'s in explicit binding, but implicit binding does not use them.
